List :==>

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
Lists are created using square brackets:
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets.

---------------------------------------------------------
Set:==>

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.  Duplicates Not Allowed

myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "year": 1964
}
